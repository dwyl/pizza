# pizza 🍕

A place to keeping track of learning how to make pizza from first principals. 👨‍🔬

If you're reading this, please don't worry, I'm not spending time on this
until our 
[`home`](https://github.com/dwyl/home) 
is _finished!
Just wanted a place to capture my research as 
[issues](https://github.com/nelsonic/pizza/issues) 
until I have time to write-up.

I've always loved pizza since I was a child.
My dad used to take us to pizzeria in 
[Jo'burg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg)
that made everything from scratch.
They knew us so well that they allowed us (kids)
into the kitchen to make our own pizzas.
I've always wanted 
to learn how to make pizza
from first principals.
And document the process for others.

That's my plan.
As soon as the house is finished. 🏡
