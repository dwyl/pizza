# pizza 🍕

A place to keeping track of learning how to make pizza from first principals. 👨‍🔬

If you're reading this, please don't worry, I'm not spending time on this
until our 
[`home`](https://github.com/dwyl/home) 
is _finished_! 🏡 🚧 ⏳

Just want somewhere to capture my research as 
[issues](https://github.com/nelsonic/pizza/issues) 
until I have time to do a more detailed write-up. <br />
(and hopefully make a few videos too!!)

I've always loved pizza since I was a child. 😋 <br />
My dad used to take us to pizzeria in 
[Jo'burg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg)
that made everything from scratch. <br />
They knew us so well that they allowed us (kids)
into the kitchen to make our own pizzas.

I've always wanted 
to learn how to make pizza
from first principals and document the process for others.

That's my plan.
As soon as the house is finished. 🏡

**Note**: Bought a few of the top-rated books on the topic. 📚 <br />
So I don't have to make _all_ the mistakes 
and can learn from the people who have already mastered the craft. 🤞

If you like pizza and want learn how to make it,
start this repo and come back to it in a few months. ⭐ 😉
